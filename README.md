Thank you for visiting my Rock, Paper, Scissors App.

This is somthing I have put together for a JavaScript Project for "Project Odin".

Updating the readMe in 2021. Trying to get my stride with git again.

# The Odin Project 
## Rock, Paper, Scissors Project

>"a simple implementation of grade-school classic `rock paper scissors`" 
- from the [Foundations curriculum ](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).

## What I Learned

 - First and formost how to piece a basic application together. I've been working on the [Free Code Camp curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/adamcodes) for some time and while the exercises are challenging and great fun, they leave much to figure out on your own.
 - Put focus into ***functional programming***. Tried to build functions that would improve the game, but would be easy to change without breaking the core functionality.
 - Learned how to prompt the user for input & use their response to progress the game.

 Thanks for dropping by!
